# In this section you can manually specify the mapping between a subvol and it's snapshot directory.
# This should only be needed if you aren't using the default nested subvols used by snapper.
#
# The format is <name> = "<snashot subvol>,<source subvol>,<UUID>"
# All should be paths relative the root of the btrfs volume and the UUID is the UUID of the filesystem
# For example, a line might look like this:
# root = "@snapshots,@,48bee883-0eef-4332-9bc5-65f01295e470"
